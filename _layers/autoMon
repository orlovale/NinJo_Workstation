# AutoMON Application

NinJo comprises the AutoMON application, which handles warnings. All warning criteria (rules) can be fully configured. The AutoMON sever reads the appropriate ingested data and checks it against the existing rules. Rules can be configured per user/client or on a side or system wide level. Users can define their own rules and activate them according to their needs. Whenever data matches a rule, the client is informed by the AutoMON server. Signal lamps show the status of events. An own client side AutoMON application can be started to configure the AutoMON rules as well as to  confirm warnings.

Currently, observational data, point forecast data, lightning data and radar data can be monitored. Other data types will be integrated in the future.
