# Aviation Layer

The aviation layer meets the special needs of aviation forecasting. Supported are GAFOR, GAMET, AIRMETSIGMET, METAR and TAF reports.

The user can define a flight path (also with stopovers) and get all reports for it. 

The reports can be copied to the clipboard, to use it in another program, or be printed directly.
