# Ocean Profile Layer

The Ocean Profile Layer shows the data of the Argo buoys. Argo is an international observation system with buoys that probe salinity, ocean temperature and the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the water down to a depth of two kilometres.

Electrical conductivity, potential density, sound speed and the sound speed gradient are computed by the data obtained.

Data can be visualised and compared in diagrams or in tables.
